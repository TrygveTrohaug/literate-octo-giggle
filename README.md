A 3D printed SCARA robot

**Goals:**
1. Learn something about how to design drivetrains and gearboxes (in general: mechanics) 
2. Learn kinematic calculations and how to implement this in a physical system 
3. Explore the limitations of FDM printing
4. Have an allright time 

## Initial Concept
We wanted to design a robot online consisting of cheap off-the-shelf parts and parts printed with a FDM printer. 

### Resolution and gearboxes

### Calculating the drivetrain
